Week 5 Assignment - Pt 2
Write a program that stores and reports information about teams in a league. It should ask the user to enter the number of teams and then ask the user to enter the name and winning percentage of each team. The information should be stored in a dynamically allocated array of structures. Each structure should have two members: a character array (or a string object) to store the name and a double member to hold the winning percentage. After reading all the data, the program should display the names and winning percentages of teams in 3 groups: Below Average (winning percentage less than 0.333 or 33.3%), Average (between 0.333 and 0.666 inclusive), and Above Average (winning percentage greater than 0.666 or 66.6%). For example, it first prints title Below Average and then team names and winning percentages (one team per line) for teams with winning percentage below 0.333. Then it does the same for Average category and finally Above Average. Note, if there are no teams in a given category, a word None should be printed.
